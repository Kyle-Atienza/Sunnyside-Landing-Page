## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Pr-processor

### What I learned

In this project i relearned the Bootstrap Framework, and coming from a vanilla css it is quite challenging, and it really refreshed my understanding of bootstrap.
